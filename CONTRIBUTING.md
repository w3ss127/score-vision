# Contributing to Score Vision (SN44)

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Score Vision as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Code Style

- Use Python's [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use descriptive variable names

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation with any changes
- Include docstrings for new functions/classes
- Update README if adding new features
- Add comments for complex logic

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
